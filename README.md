Graded Assignment 4 Checkpoint 4

I created and maintain this project, it is my Capstone project for the Women+ Cohort of Launchcode.
     
Things to note from EDA:
A large number of properties were boarded up and left as is instead of being either rehabbed or demolished. 
Permits were available as recently as January 2022 but LRA records ended at 2017. 

Things to note from data cleaning:
I was surprised at the variety of businesses given occupancy permits -t hey include offices for web design and Rehab centers for those 12-19 years old. 
The LRA records date back to the 80â€™s and I was surprised at the number of properties from that time period still within their control.

My Launchcode Project involved reviewing data from St. Louis City and the Land Reutilization Authority. My project evolved into answering two questions - first being how successful is the LRA at selling their properties to help people become home owners and revitalize the neighborhoods. Second being to understand the level of residential growth in Stl City. Here I focused on the number of Building, Occupancy and Demolition permits from 2012 - 2022 for residential properties.
